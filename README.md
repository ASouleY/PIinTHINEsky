# PIinTHINEsky
This is my Engineering 4 project
## Planning
### Goal
take pictures of landscape while in the sky and then land safely in a holder 
### Resources and Constraints
We need to use wood, metal braces, a metal pipe, and a bunch of motors
### Ideas
We are thinking of building a Trebuchet that is controlled by our pi, or a catapult, then a less likely plan is a cannon.
### The Actual Design
We are going with the epic trebuchet idea
### Drawing
