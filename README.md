# PIinTHINEsky
This is my Engineering 4 project
## Planning
### Goal
Get Pi to control object that launches payloads. 
### Resources and Constraints
We need to use wood, metal braces, a metal pipe, and a bunch of motors
### Ideas
We are thinking of building a Trebuchet that is controlled by our pi, or a catapult, then a less likely plan is a cannon.
### The Actual Design
We are going with the epic trebuchet idea
### Drawing/Blueprint

### Launch Test without Tech
The launch test with no counter wait and no technology was a succes, but it is still not what the finished product was supposed to be, we ran out of time and Aden had to work alone after Sam left, thus making work much slower than it could of been had Sam continued to help with the project.
#### Reasons for Failure
1. Rushed research and planning
2. Lack of communication between partners
3. Not finding material before the start, but during the work
If We had simply had a better schedule, or one at all, we would have most likely gotten farther on this project. Also the lack of communication between partners led to Sam not comming in to help with the project for the last couplde weeks, which if he had would have allowed the project to be much further than it is. Lastly a majority of our time was spent not working but trying to find the right screws and wood parts for our trbuchet, which could have been used to complete different things on our trebuchet.
