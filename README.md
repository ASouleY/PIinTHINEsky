# PIinTHINEsky
This is my Engineering 4 project
## Planning
### Goal
Get Pi to control object that launches payloads. 
### Resources and Constraints
We need to use wood, metal braces, a metal pipe, and a bunch of motors
### Ideas
We are thinking of building a Trebuchet that is controlled by our pi, or a catapult, then a less likely plan is a cannon.
### The Actual Design
We are going with the epic trebuchet idea
### Drawing/Blueprint

### Schedule
We are planning on splitting the work and having sam first finish with the motor/servo coard while Aden builds the Trebuchet, when Sam finishes with code he will help aden with the trebuchet, then we will work on the solidworks designs fro the gears, servo holders, and caster ball holders. Lastly we will both work on the connection of our pi to the trbuchet, then the computer to our pi. Finnaly we would create the small additions such as the satchel and the counter weight, then we would test it and troubleshoot from there.

### Schedule V.S actual time spent
While the Schedule was in place for a bit, it turned out that Aden needed more help from sam than he thought and ended up taking more of sams time than planned which led to interuptions in sams work. Next we had problems with the idea of how we were going to move the trebuchet, first we thought with mototrs, then with solinoids, and lastly we settled on servos, but that led to alot of time wasted.
### Launch Test without Tech
The launch test with no counter wait and no technology was a succes, but it is still not what the finished product was supposed to be, we ran out of time and Aden had to work alone after Sam left, thus making work much slower than it could of been had Sam continued to help with the project.
#### Reasons for Failure
1. Rushed research and planning
2. Lack of communication between partners
3. Not finding material before the start, but during the work
If We had simply had a better schedule, or one at all, we would have most likely gotten farther on this project. Also the lack of communication between partners led to Sam not comming in to help with the project for the last couplde weeks, which if he had would have allowed the project to be much further than it is. Lastly a majority of our time was spent not working but trying to find the right screws and wood parts for our trbuchet, which could have been used to complete different things on our trebuchet.
